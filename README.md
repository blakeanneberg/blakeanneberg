- 👋 Hi, I’m @blakeanneberg
- 👀 I’m interested in using github to document my learning journey with code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning alot about IT systems use my project management skills though Kanban. Some coding skills are build an API and have a revenue come though people using the API. I would also like to learn Python to get my Rasberry PI to become a air monotoring station and I am always striving to get better with my VIM skills via NeoVIM. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a real time interactive webpage/app that can showcase a hyperloop system and journey for cargo and passangers. 
- 📫 How to reach me visit blakeanneberg.com and fill out the form.
